# batch-rename

This program will open a text editor and user can specify new file names to change into

## TODO:

* Needs fail-safe mechanisms and error detection.
* Also needs to report statistic: file names changed and skipped file names.
* Also needs to auto-detect default text editor instead of assuming `vi` is installed.
